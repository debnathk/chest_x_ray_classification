**Chest X-Ray Medical Diagnosis by Building a Robust Classification Model using Keras**

•  Real-world **ChestX-ray8 dataset** containing **108,948 frontal-view X-Ray images** of 32,717 unique patients were pre-processed

•  **DenseNet model** was retrained using transfer learning for multi-class classification of Edema, Non-enhancing Tumor and Enhncing Tumor

•  **AUROC** values were in the range of **0.721** (for Infiltration) to **0.944** (for pneumothorax)
